# ING-PHP-API

Please don't mind the mess or the unorganized names, I've put this together as an experiment for myself but thought it would be nice to open-source since the purpose for which I've wanted this use it for turned out to be impossible.

Anyways, this is an ING API PHP Wrapper. It basically wraps this ING API in a PHP script using the Slim framework so you can call the urls much easier and can get some data in a more efficient way. To see a demo of using this API in a real life experience, head over to my '[ING-Banking](https://github.com/tomgekeerd/ING-Banking)' app where I use it in some iOS Swift Application.
